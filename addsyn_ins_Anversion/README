		M4C Additive Synthesis Instrument

m4c.as allows additive synthesis based on amplitude/ frequency files produced
by the SNDAN analysis/synthesis package. The only parameters are the name of
the file (enclosed in quotes), the pitch (in Oct.pitch units), an amplitude
scale factor, and lfrac, the fraction in the left speaker for stereo jobs.

This allows one to perform sound files with variable pitch independent of 
duration or with variable duration independent of pitch.

To make this instrument and a test sound file, type 'make all'.
